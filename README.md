# ButterCMS Laravel Example

This app uses Blade templates but ButterCMS works with any templating engine like Smarty, Twig, or raw PHP.

## Important Notice
This project was created as an example use case of ButterCMS in conjunction with laravel, and will not be actively maintained.

## Features

This example application demonstrates three major features of the ButterCMS API &mdash; blogging, dynamic content, and dynamic pages. All of the features are implemented in the following files:

 - `app/Http/Controllers/BlogController.php`: The application controller.
 - `routes/web.php`: The routes for the controller methods.
 - `resources/*.blade.php`: The Laravel/Blade templates used for rendering the content.

### Blogging

The blogging features are split into four main areas withing the app &mdash; posts, categories, tags, and authors. Each area has a main page and a detail page.

 - #### Posts
   Blog posts are loaded in the `listAllPosts()` and `showPost()` methods of the `BlogController` and rendered to the `posts.blade.php` and `post.blade.php` templates.
 - #### Categories
   Post categories are loaded in the `listAllCategories()` and `showCategory()` methods and rendered to the `categories.blade.php` and `category.blade.php` templates.
 - #### Tags
   Post tags are loaded in the `listAllTags()` and `showTag()` methods and rendered to the `tags.blade.php` and `tag.blade.php` templates.
 - #### Authors
   Post authors are loaded in the `listAllAuthors()` and `showAuthor()` methodsd and rendered to the `authors.blade.php` and `author.blade.php` templates.

### Dynamic Content

Dynamic content is demonstrated with a Frequenly Asked Question page. FAQ questions and answers, as well as the page headline, are loaded in the `showFaq()` method of the `BlogController` and rendered to the `faq.blade.php` template.

### Dynamic Pages

Dynamic pages are demonstrated with mock store location pages. Location page data is loaded by the `listAllLocations()` and `showLocation()` method of the `BlogController` and rendered to the `locations.blade.php` and `location.blade.php` templates.
